## **Zero-shot Task Transfer for Invoice Extraction via Class-aware QA Ensemble**

VESPA is a novel zero-shot system for a layout, locale, and domain agnostic document extraction. It works with form-like documents with unstructured information e.g. invoices, bills and receipts, long-form documents e.g. legal contracts and format-less documents e.g Annual Reports

**Contributions and empirical claims:**

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by evaluating on a closed corpus of real-world retail and tax invoices with multiple complex layouts, domains and geographies. The empirical evaluation shows that:

(1) Our system outperforms 4 commercial invoice solutions that use discriminatively trained models with architectures specifically crafted for invoice extraction. We extracted 6 fields with zero upfront human annotation and training with an **Avg. F1 of 87.50.**

(2) Our framework generalizes well on non-form-based documents like legal contracts and format-less documents like annual reports with **Avg. F1 of 81.2 and 86.42 respectively**

(3) Our class-aware QA ensemble with diverse network architectures outperforms single QA models.
